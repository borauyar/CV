            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                As a computational biologist and bioinformatician, my background includes developing innovative algorithms, machine learning techniques, and software tools to address critical challenges in genomics, molecular biology, and disease research. My work spans four main categories: genomics and gene expression analysis, single-cell and transcriptomics, molecular interactions and disease mechanisms, and bioinformatics tools and reproducibility. My computational skills have enabled me to develop novel methods, integrate diverse data types, and analyze complex biological systems. With my expertise in machine learning, algorithm development, and data analysis, I have made significant contributions to the understanding of gene regulation, molecular interactions, and disease mechanisms, and developed essential tools for the bioinformatics community.

                <p>
                    The crispr-DART software is used to analyze indel mutations in targeted DNA sequencing, providing insights into the impact of mutations on gene expression and fitness. By applying the software in conjunction with inducible Cas9 and multiplexed guide RNAs, researchers can study regulatory sequences directly in animals, helping to understand their role in health and disease.

                    This study compiles and analyzes aging-related single-cell gene expression datasets, highlighting unique insights that are difficult to obtain from bulk data. The findings reveal increased cellular senescence markers, inflammatory processes, and transcriptional heterogeneity with age, suggesting single-cell experiments could provide critical information for interventions targeting aging, inflammation, senescence, and disease.

                <h3>Mutations in Disordered Regions Can Cause Disease by Creating Dileucine Motifs. Cell, 2018 </h3>
                <p>
                   The study investigates the impact of mutations in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins on protein-protein interactions, finding that mutations in three transmembrane proteins lead to increased clathrin binding and create dileucine motifs. The research reveals that several mutations in disordered regions cause "dileucineopathies," with gained dileucine motifs being significantly overrepresented in structurally disordered cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins.
